Activities/Catalyze","title":"Catalyze","description":"Design is about making things. Thinking systemically can often feel overwhelming, so making things helps move you forward. It shows people what a new vision looks and feels like in a tangible way, so they can get behind it or add their ideas to it. Prototyping (or mocking up) an idea is an important way to test how it works, explore how it connects with other interventions, and see what else develops or grows from it.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Design Activities/Create":{"id":"Design Activities/Create","title":"Create","description":"Creating a series of different actions and ideas that can connect with other interventions and help designers move towards a bigger goal. Some can be small practical steps and others can be big audacious ideas that might never happen but will help people reimagine what might be possible. This is about thinking big.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Design Activities/Explore":{"id":"Design Activities/Explore","title":"Explore","description":"\\"Throughout the design process, we need to explore deeply and widely what is happening, determine the root cause of the issue, consider what ideas and resources exist already that we can re-use and build from, and develop a bold and hopeful vision of what the future might look like. As designers, we must reflect on our own position, and actively draw in perspectives that are different from ours, including those which have historically been marginalised.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Design Activities/Reframe":{"id":"Design Activities/Reframe","title":"Reframe","description":"Moving to a more equal, regenerative world means breaking out of our current way of thinking. It means creating things \u2013 products, places and services \u2013 that reflect new values and shift our collective behaviours. We must allow time and permission to reframe the problem in different ways to act as a springboard for new ideas.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Enabling Activities/Connections and Relationships":{"id":"Enabling Activities/Connections and Relationships","title":"Connections and Relationships","description":"\\"Systemic design is hard work, is never finished, and requires tenacity and hope. It is easier to do with allies. Relationship building happens throughout the design process and is as important as the design itself. It is about building empathy and bringing in the perspectives of all involved in the work: stakeholders, communities and mother nature herself. This work is about creating trust and shared understanding, building confidence for others to imagine and create, and joining the dots between disparate organisations that could work together in new ways. Acting as translators and mediators, designers connect people across a project in a way that is perhaps not immediately quantifiable but undoubtedly vital, and provides value way beyond the project itself.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Enabling Activities/Continuing the Journey":{"id":"Enabling Activities/Continuing the Journey","title":"Continuing the Journey","description":"\\"In dynamic systems, our work is never done. Things change and other opportunities arise. As your project comes to a close, you should reflect on it and learn from any mistakes. Your outcomes must be open-ended, focused on creating and sharing knowledge for future work. Consider what you have measured, return to your vision to determine how successful your project has been, and consider what needs to come next in the journey.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Enabling Activities/Leadership and Storytelling":{"id":"Enabling Activities/Leadership and Storytelling","title":"Leadership and Storytelling","description":"\\"Anyone can be a leader. It starts with personal actions as well as your position within an organisation. Leaders offer a vision that is rooted in their values. They carry this through at all levels, from their own actions including finding and sharing stories to influence and inspire the wider system.\\"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Enabling Activities/Orientation and Vision Setting":{"id":"Enabling Activities/Orientation and Vision Setting","title":"Orientation and Vision Setting","description":"\\"How you start your work will determine the outcome.
